Code for making graphs for covid19

The site is currently served at http://www.paulhtremblay.com will change this site to henry-data.com
in the futre. If I have enough contributors, I will use a name reflects the efforts of he group.

Building the website:

the bash make.sh does the following:

1. calls on the individual scripts to generate bokeh objects and copy these
objects to the html_temp dir

2. insert the objects into an html document

3. copy all .html files to a bucket in GCP, wher they are served. 

It would be better to have the site served via https, but I will only do
that if I get help on the front end. 

Back end
